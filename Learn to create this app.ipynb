    "\n",
    "- SQLAlchemy is a package we used as the main center to connect to databases like postgres, mysql databases etc\n",
    "- SQLAlchemy handles all Connection pooling, Transaction isolation, Concurrency safety, has ORM, used for relational databases.. and many more\n",
    "- URL -> SQLAlchemy -> Engine -> Pool allocation -> Request arrival -> Engine -> Session -> Database -> Engine -> Close session\n",
    "- SQLAlchemy does NOT open a database connection when you create the engine. It opens a connection only when the first query actually needs it.\n",
    "    - Why lazy connections are important ??\n",
    "\n",
    "        If SQLAlchemy were eager instead of lazy:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        - App startup would:\n",

    "        - You’d waste connections even if:\n",
    "            - App never hits DB\n",
    "            - Some routes don’t need DB\n",

    "    - when there is session.execute(query), it says “I actually need a connection → open one now.”\n",
    "- It will be empty pools if there is no requirements, Engine say “I know how to connect, but I haven’t connected yet.”\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Driver\n",

    "- Assigns tokens (session) to new requests.\n",
