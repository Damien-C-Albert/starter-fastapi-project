    "\n",
    "#### SQLAlchemy\n",
    "\n",
    "- SQLAlchemy is a package we used as the main center to connect to databases like postgres, mysql databases etc\n",
    "- SQLAlchemy handles all Connection pooling, Transaction isolation, Concurrency safety, has ORM, used for relational databases.. and many more\n",
    "- URL -> SQLAlchemy -> Engine -> Pool allocation -> Request arrival -> Engine -> Session -> Database -> Engine -> Close session\n",
    "- SQLAlchemy does NOT open a database connection when you create the engine. It opens a connection only when the first query actually needs it.\n",
    "    - Why lazy connections are important ??\n",
    "\n",
    "        If SQLAlchemy were eager instead of lazy:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        - App startup would:\n",
    "            - Open DB connections immediately\n",
    "            - Fail if DB is temporarily down\n",
    "        - You’d waste connections even if:\n",
    "            - App never hits DB\n",
    "            - Some routes don’t need DB\n",
    "- Connections are only created when first query runs, when connections is required.\n",
    "    - when there is session.execute(query), it says “I actually need a connection → open one now.”\n",
    "- It will be empty pools if there is no requirements, Engine say “I know how to connect, but I haven’t connected yet.”\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Driver\n",
    "\n",
    "- Although we don't manually import drivers anywhere in code, we must need driver to connect to the appropriate databases\n",
    "    - PostgreSQL (Async) - asyncpg - postgresql+asyncpg://\n",

    "- Guard of the connection pool\n",
    "- Manages the connetion pool\n",
    "- Assigns tokens (session) to new requests.\n",
    "- if 10 connections are there, each parallel reqeusts are passed to different connections hence different session. 11th parallel request has to wait to get a session until one of them releases their session.\n",
    "- create engine globally instead of creating in each request inside our application\n",
    "- Engine creation is expensive, behind the scenes:\n",
    "    - DNS resolution - parsing the url\n",
    "    - TCP, TLS handshake\n",
    "    - Authentication - username password verification etc.\n",
    "    - session initilization\n",
    "    - kernel resources\n",
    "- Engine creation might take around 10-100ms per connection, that X100 request = disaster. so create engine(guard) globally\n",

    "- It begins when a connection is established and ends upon disconnection, log out, or a timeout due to inactivity. \n",
    "- How session is created:\n",
